Now that the winter season is upon us, the holidays are coming up and I have more free time in general, I have decided to give another try to a field of IT I tried to enter many times before to not much avail: **Operating Systems**. This project started off pretty rocky as well, but after switching to Limine it was a much better experience than anything I have tried before :D

Now I can't say that this project is a fully fledged complete OS or even just a usable hobby OS; It's a tech demo, really. However I got much further than ever before, I learned a good amount about lower-level programming and the inner workings of OSes, and although I can't say that I didn't need to look up Stack Overflow, the OSDev Wiki or (blasphemy) ChatGPT a few times, I am still proud of what I have achieved and I think it came out great! 

Although if (and when) I try a similar project again I might learn Rust first and then do [Philipp Oppermann's tutorial](https://os.phil-opp.com/) to learn the basics better; It seems like a really well put together tutorial and I can't wait to try it out - maybe for Boot YSWS?


## How to build
1. Download the code and unzip
2. Set up Limine in the folder via [This tutorial](https://wiki.osdev.org/Limine_Bare_Bones)
3. Run `build.sh`
4. If you want to rebuild, run `make clean` first.


# How to run
1. Either build the OS or download the newest release
2. Burn the .iso to a USB or insert it into a VM
3. Enjoy! This requires no installation (I have no idea how you could even do that 😭)
